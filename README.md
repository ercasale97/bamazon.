Welcome to Bamazon. Bamazon has an Amazon-like storefront built with Node.js, MySQL, and the Prompt Package.

Bamazon will take in orders from customers and deplete the store’s total supplies.

Initializing node bamazon.js in the command line will bring up the storefront. It will then ask you what you’d like to purchase by item number and how many:
